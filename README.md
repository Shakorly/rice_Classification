# rice_Classification Model

This repository contains a PyTorch-based machine learning model designed to classify rice samples into different classes (e.g., "Class 0" and "Class 1") based on input features. The model uses a neural network with multiple layers, trained and evaluated with a focus on achieving high accuracy and robust performance.
